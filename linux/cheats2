Linux Command Line Cheat Sheet by DaveChild

A cheat sheet of the commands I use most for Linux, with popup links to man

Thanks for creating this cheat-sheet Dave. The one thing I missed was "grep
-o"; Show only the part of a matching line that matches PATTERN

DaveChild DaveChild, 10:02 28 Nov 11

I've added "grep -o" to the cheat sheet :)

a_statham a_statham, 10:02 28 Nov 11

The I/O redirection section could use "2>" and "&>" examples, I always forget
how to redirect stderr

DaveChild DaveChild, 10:02 28 Nov 11

Good idea - I'll add that (once I remember how they work myself ... :) )

DaveChild DaveChild, 10:02 28 Nov 11

I've updated that section to include stderr redirection. :)

wattslevi wattslevi, 19:51 29 Nov 11

How are the indented lines added several of the cells like Screen Shortcuts?
RE: http://getsatisfaction.com/cheatography/topics/
adding_a_two_line_entry_in_a_list

DaveChild DaveChild, 08:35 30 Nov 11

Those indented bits are a "question and answer" format box.

wattslevi wattslevi, 10:30 30 Nov 11

Ah, Q&A means I would be able to cheat with it and use it for two column with
an extra line. Thanks for the info.

(Replying to my original post seems unintuitive for trying to reply under your
post, but not to the overall thread... assuming this post as I'm thinking it
might.)

jim jim, 23:12 30 Nov 11

On the redirects, the one I most commonly use is ignoring errors (2>/dev/null,
or more succinctly 2>&- ).

For example, if I'm looking for files and I don't care that I haven't access to
parts of the filesystem, we might do something like:

find / -name "*.html" 2>&-

Tanner Tanner, 10:30 7 Mar 12

ls -h is handy - changes sizes to human readable formats. Goes along good with
-S. If I'm using it it is generally a ls -alhS

Wane Wane, 07:28 21 Mar 12

I think the "Bash Shortcuts" part is a little misleading. The "ctrl-a",
"ctrl-e", "ctrl-k" is in emacs mode. But there should be many people preferring
vim-mode or some thing like that.

Davis Peng Davis Peng, 13:57 22 Mar 12

Thanks a lot for your sheet, I just need such a linux command summary such as
this sheet.

gamiclea gamiclea, 00:05 2 Jun 12

Awesome job! This will definitely come in handy

wolvverine wolvverine, 11:29 6 Jun 12

Chetan Morajkar Chetan Morajkar, 14:35 6 Aug 12

Hi,

Fantastic good job..

Thanks

Donald J. Tambeau Donald J. Tambeau, 15:23 6 Aug 12

Love your work....it is so ....so helpful! I would like to format a MicroDisk
using Linux Centros. When I look at the Partition on the MicroDisk, I see the
following comment....(non-Linux). This makes sense, since I formatted with a
computer running Win 7! I want to use it on my Linux system but do not know how
to do it. I tried format /dev/scd1 but no joy!
Thank you
Don

Eric Eric, 08:59 7 Aug 12

I'd just like to point out a trick I use with the head and tail commands:
First, you can designate the number of lines to return, like so: head -100
filename
I often use both head and tail together to get a section of a file by piping
the output of one into the other. The following command gets 100 lines,
starting 1000 lines before the end of the file:
tail -1000 filename | head -100
You could, of course, reverse the commands to get a section near the top of the
file. To get lines 91-100:
head -100 filename | tail -10

Mark Mark, 08:53 29 Aug 12

I just wanted to take a moment to thank you for putting this together. This is
a big help to me I am new to OpenFiler witch I believe uses bash at the core so
I am of course new to Linux. I didn't really think it would be quite so
difficult to find resources that one can use to navigate the command line but I
guess most folks use the GUI. But, I'm not most folks when I bought my first
IBM 8088 I started with DOS.Anyway, thanks for the time and effort you put into
this, sorry about digressing there.

Shrinath Shrinath, 13:08 4 Oct 12

Excellent Stuff man.. I think these are the most commonly used commands.. Good
Effort.

JImmy JImmy, 21:43 11 Oct 12

you need to figure out how to split your command sheet as a pdf

Niloufar Niloufar, 21:43 11 Oct 12

hi!.these are useful cheat sheet .

russ russ, 16:18 22 Oct 12

CTRL-Z sleeps (stops) the running process. fg [#] brings it back to foreground.

top
CTRL-Z
ps aux | grep top
fg

chiahsun chiahsun, 11:14 2 Jan 13

Show human readable format (kb, mb...)
ls -lh

PierreBdR PierreBdR, 11:35 9 Feb 13

This cheat-sheet is very good! Thanks for that.

However, I don't like the "chmod" commands you are using. I don't think anybody
should use the numeric version of chmod anymore. Your example "chmod -R 600
folder", is the best way to lock yourself out of your own folder and loose any
executable bits on the scripts. I would rather use the symbolic version:

chmod -R u+rw folder # Add read-write for user on all files in folder
chmod -R og-rwx # Remove read write and execute bits for "other" and "group" on
all files in folder

And my all-time favorite:

chmod -R og=u-w folder # Give other and group the same rights as user, but
removing writing rights.

Of course, this also handles t and s bits:

chmod u+s file
chmod o+t folder

Stylius Stylius, 09:17 15 Feb 13

I would also add the tar command. No sysadmin would survive without it.

To extract tar.gz archive
tar xvzf archive.tar.gz

To extract tar.bz2 archive
tar xvjf archive.tar.bz2

To extract tar archive
tar xvf archive.tar

To create archive
tar cvzf archive.tar.gz /file_or_folder/to/archive

Sandeep Sandeep, 08:43 16 Feb 13

Nice one...really helpful

John John, 08:43 16 Feb 13

Great resource - thanks for taking the time and trouble to put this out there.

My favorite ls options are '-ltr' . The t sorts files by time, and r reverses
that, so newest files show up right above the prompt, no matter how long the
listing is.

daveydave400 daveydave400, 08:43 16 Feb 13

What about CTRL+y to paste the stuff you cut back in? How can you leave that
out? CTRL+a/e and CTRL+u/y are the pairs I remember.

gymka gymka, 08:44 16 Feb 13

Missing: sed
find -exec

Jared Jared, 10:33 26 Feb 13

Nice work, but it would be best as a single page PDF.

Darr247 Darr247, 16:31 5 Apr 13

Or if the PDF at least split into 2 pages (so it could be a laminated 2-sided
sheet) without cutting commands in half.

PastExpiryDotCom PastExpiryDotCom, 18:08 11 Jul 13

This is bash-tastic!

kimcy929 kimcy929, 11:09 9 Aug 13

thank you very much, it is great

Pradeep Pradeep, 15:12 13 Feb 14

There is no commands for shutdown or reboot..

RobertAttfieldDotCom RobertAttfieldDotCom, 11:37 14 Feb 14

Good job on the cheatsheet - this will definitely come in handy for my Linux
exam next week. Some commands on umask would be a good addition to this
cheatsheet :).

Bill Bill, 17:30 17 Feb 14

Hi, handy sheet. Just one thing. Find will do a recursive search by default. In
the find /dir -name name* should be in double quotes if you want it to
recursively find all files starting with name:

find /dir/ -name "name*"

That's because, without the quotes, the shell will expand the wildcard before
handing the parameters to find. To unexpected things might happen if you don't
have the quotes. Please see the examples below:

$ find .
.
./name1
./name2
./dir1
./dir1/name3
./dir1/name1
./dir1/test3
./test1
$ find . -name name*
find: paths must precede expression: name2

grep -B#

This shows what you are searching plus additional lines where number is added.
Great for DHCP lease searching.

I would suggest to put in screen <tty.device> <baudrate> ??? just in case
anybody needs to connect to some serial console???

Henning Henning, 09:57 19 Feb 14

Great reference!
The section on Screen is missing "Ctrl-A d" for detaching.

Command that might be used to test connectivity of Linux box to the Internet,
get logged on user info, and get TCP/IP configuration info. Can anyone help me?

I've always found `mkdir -p path/to/directory` to be useful.

head -n1 /etc/issue as a means to access distribution name isn't reliable,
since the post-login screen could have been customized.

A more reliable version would be sed -nr 's/^PRETTY_NAME=(.*)/\1/p' /etc/
os-release . This should be true even for distros using legacy init (i.e.,
current Debian, Gentoo and even Slackware).

ls -h? human readable?

DF DF, 08:31 25 Aug 15

would be good to add Ctrl-left/right for jumping arguments, Ctrl-home/end for
jumping whole line.

'echo $SHELL' actually prints the default shell, 'ps -p $$' will print the
current shell

Love the colour, but could it be a slightly darker/stronger green? It comes out
almost impossible to read on my colour printer. I tried outputting in
greyscale, but the green-on green sections are still unreadable. Needs more
contrast.

Alternatively, change all the green texts to black and keep the backgrounds
green?

DaveChild DaveChild, 16:05 28 Mar 16

I agree, it's not a great colour. I've changed it.

Felipe Felipe, 19:22 3 Apr 16

Could you add "passwd" to the file? :)
